The mordern day prolems need the ability to apply knowledge to new situations and different domains, and that's why I wanted to be a Data Scientist , to create unorthodox solutions by using combination of various fields including Computer Science, Mathematics and Statistics, and Business Strategy. During my undergraduate years, I have attended classes inside and ouside Washington State University that are not required in my degrees, not because they're easy, but because they are challenging and has taught me always apporaching problems from diffrent perspectives than normal. For example, when I been asked to analyzing students academic performance in a sepecific class, beside the students'grades in class, I also need to consider many other Attributes from the student that could effct the outcome, such as, does the distribution of the student grades in that class are similar every semester, does different instructor effect student grades, does the course combination effect student grades,etc.

During my first two years of my undergraduate journey, it was difficult for me to transition into college life. I was distracted and had no direction with what I wanted to do in the future. Luckily, an ITS manager who believed in me offered me an opportunity to become a Data Analyst intern for Washington State University Enterprise. This internship allowed me to observe real world problems which fueled my passion towards the data science field and my academic accomplishments have gone up since then. I have redirected my life, added an Applied Mathematic degree, allowing me to set an academic goal and excute it.

I believe I am more than qualified to successed in MSDS program, because I have the skills and experience to make an impact with the provided data.
