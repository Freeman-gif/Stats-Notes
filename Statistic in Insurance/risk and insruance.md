# risk and insruance

## Notes and Ideas:

[[insurance]] is an agreetment where, for a stipulated  paytment, called [[premium]], one party (the [[Insurer ]]) agrees to pay to the other party(the [[policyholder]] or [[Insured]]) a defined amount(called a [[benifit]]) upon the occurrene of a speccific loss, the [[premium]] paid by the [[policyholder]] to the [[insurer]] is an amount that is representative of the expected amount of _loss_ is associated with the [[risk exposure to loss]]. The expected amount of loss is calculated by grouping together larger numbers of individuals with <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">similiar characterstics</mark> and estimating the distributions of both number of claims [[frequency]] and amount of claims [[Severity]] for this pool of individuals. Each [[policyholder]] excahnges a potential unknown loss for a know premium.

The insurer dictates the terms of the ocnstract, they determine what is <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">covered</mark>. the insurer dictates what typers or causes of loss (referred to as [[perils]]) will be covered abd they will specify how claims amounts will be calculated and paid. An insurance policy should be specific enoigh that there is minimal risk of "Hazards". Hazards are condisitons that increase the probability [[moral ]] or expected magnitude [[morle]] of loss. A [[moral]] hazard is one in which the<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;"> insured</mark> has an <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">incentive</mark> to cause a loss or <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">inflate</mark> the severity of the loss. A [[moral]] hazard is one in which causes the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">insured</mark> to be carelss, negligent or reckless

==A risk is consider <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">insureable</mark>  if it has the following properites:==

1. The potential for loss must be significant and important enough that substituting a known insurance [[premium]] for an unknown economic loss is <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">desirable</mark> . (==There's a need to transfer risk==)
2. The loss and ecnomic values must be well-defined and out of the [[policyholder]]'s control. (==can be estimated and not intentinal== )
3. The [[policyholder]] should not be allowed to <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">encourage</mark> a loss that will lead to a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">benefit</mark> or claim payment.(==[[avoid ]]moral hazerd==)
4. after tbe loss occurs, the [[policyholder]] should not be able to unfarily adjust the valies of the loss in order to <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">increase</mark> the amount or claim payment.(==[[avoid]] moral hazerd==)
5. Covered losses should be <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">reasonably</mark> [[Independent ]]

If a risk does not satisfy all these criteria, additional criteria or exclusions may be added to a policy to make a risk insurable.
