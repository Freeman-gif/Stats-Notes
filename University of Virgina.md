### Notes and Ideas:

Start:
I always wanted to be a generalist, so I could solve a problem whether it would require technical, business or analytical skills.  During my undergraduate years, I have attended classes that are not required in my degrees, not because they're easy, but because they are challenging and taught always apporaching problems from diffrent perspective than normal. that's also why I Enroll into Data Analytic degree. 

During my first two years of my undergraduate journey, it was difficult for me to transition into college life. I was distracted and had no direction with what I wanted to do in the future. Luckily, an ITS manager who believed in me offered me an opportunity to become a Data Analyst intern for Washington State University Enterprise. This internship allowed me to observe real world problems which fueled my passion towards the data science field and my academic accomplishments have gone up since then. I have redirected my life, added an Applied Mathematic degree, allowing me to set an academic goal and excute it.

I always wanted to be a generalist, so I could solve a problem whether it would require technical, business or analytical skills. During my undergraduate years, I have attended classes that are not required in my degrees, not because they're easy, but because they're interesting and challenging. Taking different classes and being involved in different projects has encouraged me to seek out unorthodox solutions for the Modern day problems.  .

**Why I am interesting in MSDS in UVA(Short term)**
   - why UVA
	   - professor
	   - research
	   - courses
	- what's the outcome I am lookign for 
		- I want to use data to improve people life
		- I want to get deeper into machine learning in order to create  genrate unbias and consistency model to make a impact for people
		- Able to use Mathematical Methods in the Real life Application

**Long Term**:
	- Depend how much information I will receive through the 11 month programs
		-Alternative :
					- if I feel I need more knowledge
						- Getting into doctoral program:
							- Statistical 
							- informational science 
						- 
					- if I am confident to apply the knowledge I learned 
						- industrial 
							- looking to study something related to the field that I can analyzing
