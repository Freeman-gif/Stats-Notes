A function f(x) is a discrete pdf(pmf) iff satisfies both of the following properties for at most a ocuntably infinite set of reals$x_1,x_2,....$
$$f(x_i)\geq 0\space for \space all \space x_i$$
and $$\sum_{all\space x_i}f(x_i)=1$$


| x    | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| f(x) |$\frac {1}{16}$ |$\frac {3}{16}$|$\frac {5}{16}$|$\frac {7}{16}$ |
